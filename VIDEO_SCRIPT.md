## 📹 SCRIPT STRUCTURE

### SECTION 1: HOOK & PROBLEM STATEMENT (0:00 - 1:00)
**Location**: Start with your homepage live demo  
**Tone**: Energetic, relatable, problem-focused  
**Visuals**: Show homepage hero section

#### Script:
*"Hey everyone! Imagine you see a massive pothole on your daily commute, or a streetlight that's been broken for weeks. You want to report it, but the process is confusing, slow, and you never know if anyone's even looking at your complaint."*

*(Pause for emphasis)*

*"This is the reality for millions of citizens across India. Traditional civic complaint systems are opaque, inefficient, and frustrating. But what if we could change that with AI?"*

*(Show excitement building)*

*"I'm [Your Name], and today I'm excited to show you **CivicAgent** - an AI-powered platform that transforms civic engagement from frustrating to effortless. In the next 8 minutes, I'll show you how we built a system that uses Google Gemini AI to automatically detect and categorize civic issues, track them transparently, and ensure nothing falls through the cracks."*

**Tips**: 
- Maintain eye contact with camera
- Use hand gestures to emphasize "AI-powered" and "transparent"
- Smile when introducing yourself - build rapport

### SECTION 2: UNIQUE VALUE PROPOSITION (1:00 - 2:00)
**Location**: Navigate to GitHub README - scroll to "Unique Value Proposition" table  
**Tone**: Confident, comparison-focused, data-driven  
**Visuals**: Highlight the comparison table on screen

#### Script:
*"Let me show you what makes CivicAgent different from existing solutions."*

*(Scroll slowly through the comparison table)*

*"While apps like Swachhata require manual category selection and offer limited transparency, CivicAgent uses **Google Gemini Vision AI** to automatically detect what the issue is - pothole, garbage dump, broken streetlight - with up to 99% confidence. And we don't stop at detection."*

*(Point to specific table cells)*

*"Our **autonomous follow-up system** sends automated reminders, escalates complaints when SLAs are breached, and provides explainable AI decisions using SHAP - so administrators know exactly why a complaint was escalated."*

*(Emphasize the transparency point)*

*"Most importantly, everything happens on a **public monitoring dashboard**. Any citizen can track any complaint in real-time. That's true accountability."*

**Tips**:
- Use your cursor to highlight key differentiators as you mention them
- Slow down when reading numbers/percentages
- Show genuine pride when discussing SHAP explainability

---

### SECTION 3: ARCHITECTURE WALKTHROUGH (2:00 - 3:30)
**Location**: GitHub README - scroll to "Architecture & Workflow" mermaid diagram  
**Tone**: Technical but accessible, use analogies  
**Visuals**: Zoom in on the architecture diagram sections

#### Script:
*"Now let's talk about how this actually works under the hood. Here's our system architecture."*

*(Point to Frontend section)*

*"On the **frontend**, we have a Next.js 14 application with the App Router - giving us server-side rendering, optimal performance, and a beautiful UI built with Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui components. We integrated Leaflet for interactive maps with location search powered by Nominatim."*

*(Move to Backend section)*

*"The **backend** is a FastAPI server running Python 3.11. This is where the magic happens. When a user submits a complaint with a photo..."*

*(Trace the flow with cursor: Frontend → API → Gemini)*

*"...the image goes to **Google Gemini Vision**, which analyzes it in under 2 seconds and returns a structured report - category, confidence score, detected objects, and severity assessment."*

*(Point to Scheduler)*

*"But here's the really cool part - we have an **APScheduler** running autonomous jobs. Every hour, it checks for complaints approaching SLA deadlines. If a complaint is 3 days old with no action, it automatically sends reminder emails via Brevo. If it crosses the threshold, our **ML Decision Model** - a logistic regression trained on historical data - decides whether to escalate it."*

*(Highlight SHAP connection)*

*"And because we use **SHAP**, we can show administrators exactly which factors - complaint age, category, previous actions - influenced that escalation decision. That's transparency at the AI level."*

*(Point to Database)*

*"Everything is stored in **Supabase** - which gives us PostgreSQL, authentication, and object storage in one platform. Real-time subscriptions keep the frontend in sync automatically."*

**Tips**:
- Use your cursor like a pointer - trace the data flow
- Pause after introducing each major component
- Speak slightly slower during technical explanations
- Show enthusiasm when revealing "the cool part"

#### Script:
*"Alright, let's see this in action. I'm going to show you the complete citizen journey."*

#### 4A: Sign Up (0:30)
*(Navigate to signup page)*

*"First, a citizen signs up - we support email/password and Google OAuth for convenience. All authentication is handled securely by Supabase."*

*(Complete signup quickly)*

#### 4B: Submit Complaint (2:00)
*(Go to /submit)*

*"Now, let's report an issue. This is a **three-step guided workflow**."*

*(Upload an image of a pothole)*

*"**Step 1**: I upload a photo of a pothole I found near my neighborhood."*

*(Wait for AI analysis - show the spinner)*

*"Watch this - our AI is analyzing the image right now..."*

*(AI results appear)*

*"Boom! In 2 seconds, Gemini Vision detected this is a **Pothole** with **92% confidence**. It even identified the objects in the image and assessed the severity. I can confirm this detection or change it if needed."*

*(Click Confirm, move to Step 2)*

*"**Step 2**: Location selection. I can use my current GPS location, manually drag the marker, or - here's a nice touch - **search for a location** using the search bar."*

*(Type "Connaught Place, Delhi" in the search bar)*

*"Type an address or landmark, select from suggestions, and the marker jumps right there. Much better than just GPS."*

*(Move to Step 3)*

*"**Step 3**: Add details. The category is already filled from AI detection, but I can add a landmark and detailed description."*

*(Fill in form quickly)*

*"Landmark: 'Near Central Park entrance.' Description: 'Large pothole causing traffic issues, needs urgent repair.'"*

*(Submit)*

*"Submit - and done! Our complaint is now in the system."*

#### 4C: Track Complaint (1:00)
*(Navigate to /dashboard)*

*"As a citizen, I can now track all my complaints from my personal dashboard. Each complaint shows real-time status updates, AI-generated insights, and a complete timeline of actions taken."*

*(Click on the submitted complaint)*

*"Here's our pothole complaint. We can see the status timeline, the AI-generated report, the exact location on the map, and even the photo evidence."*

*(Scroll through the page)*

*"Once it's resolved, I can rate the resolution and provide feedback - creating a feedback loop for continuous improvement."*

**Tips**:
- Keep demo smooth - practice beforehand to avoid fumbling
- Narrate every action *before* clicking - build anticipation
- Show genuine reaction to AI results ("Boom!", "Watch this")
- Maintain steady pace - not too fast, not too slow

#### 5A: Dashboard Overview (0:45)
*"The **Public Monitoring Dashboard** gives everyone a bird's-eye view of all complaints. We have real-time statistics - total complaints, how many are submitted, in progress, escalated, and resolved."*

*(Point to stat cards)*

*"Right now we have [X] total complaints, with [Y] escalated cases that need urgent attention."*

*(Scroll to "Civic Intelligence" section)*

*"This section here is our **Phase 3 vision** - we're planning to add heatmaps showing complaint density across the city and performance metrics tracking department efficiency. That's the future of data-driven governance."*

#### 5B: Advanced Filtering (0:45)
*(Scroll to complaints table)*

*"Here's where the real power is. Administrators can search by ID, category, or description. But watch this - we have **multi-layered filtering**."*

*(Use filters)*

*"Filter by status - show me only escalated complaints. Filter by category - just potholes. Combine them - escalated potholes in the last week."*

*(Clear filters)*

*"And with one click, clear all filters and start fresh. This makes managing hundreds of complaints actually manageable."*

#### 5C: Complaint Detail View (0:30)
*(Click on a complaint)*

*"When an admin opens a complaint, they see everything - AI analysis, user description, photo evidence, location map, and a complete action timeline showing every email sent, every status change, every escalation."*

*(Show the update status dropdown)*

*"They can update the status right here, and the citizen gets notified immediately. Transparency in action."*

**Tips**:
- Use filters confidently and quickly - show mastery
- Emphasize "real-time" and "transparency" repeatedly
- Point out Phase 3 vision to show forward thinking

### SECTION 6: CODE WALKTHROUGH (7:00 - 8:30)
**Location**: Switch to VS Code or GitHub repository  
**Tone**: Technical, proud of craftsmanship, educational  
**Visuals**: Navigate through key files

#### Script:
*"Let's dive into the code that makes this possible. I'll show you three key components."*

#### 6A: AI Service (0:45)
*(Open backend/app/services/gen_ai.py)*

*"First, the **AI integration**. Here's our `gen_ai.py` file. This function takes an image, converts it to base64, and sends it to Google Gemini Vision with a carefully crafted prompt."*

*(Scroll to the prompt)*

*"The prompt asks Gemini to analyze the image and return structured JSON with category, confidence, objects detected, severity, and suggested department. We parse that response and return it to the frontend - all in under 2 seconds."*

#### 6B: Autonomous Agent (0:45)
*(Open backend/app/services/agent_workflow.py)*

*"Next, the **autonomous agent workflow**. This file orchestrates all the background automation. The `check_pending_complaints` function runs every hour."*

*(Scroll through the logic)*

*"It fetches complaints that are 3 days old, checks if they've been followed up, sends reminder emails, and if they're 5 days old, it triggers the decision model to determine if escalation is needed. All completely autonomous."*

#### 6C: Frontend Component (0:30)
*(Open frontend/components/complaint-form.tsx)*

*"Finally, a quick look at the **frontend**. This is our complaint form component - it's a multi-step wizard built with React hooks and state management. We use dynamic imports for the map component to avoid SSR issues with Leaflet, and everything is type-safe with TypeScript."*

*(Scroll through)*

*"Clean, maintainable, production-ready code."*

**Tips**:
- Don't read code line-by-line - highlight architecture and patterns
- Use terms like "production-ready," "type-safe," "maintainable"
- Keep it high-level unless asked to deep dive
